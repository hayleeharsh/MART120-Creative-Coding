        Once upon a time there was a family of tomatoes. There was Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato, and Baby Tomato. One day, the family decided
        to go for a hike. 
        <br />
        <br />
        On the trail, Baby Tomato stopped to pick up a cool rock he noticed to admire it. Papa Tomato saw this and said, "Hurry up! You're falling behind"
        Baby Tomato dropped the rock and ran after his parents.
        <br />
        <br />
        A little while later, Baby Tomato saw a cool bush he had never seen before. He stopped to stare at the berries and leaves while his parents walked in front of him. 
        Papa Tomato, now getting upset, yelled back to Baby Tomato. He said, "Baby! Keep up!" Baby Tomato ran to catch up with his parents.
        <br />
        <br />
        Baby Tomato was determined to stay focused and keep the pace of his parents. Unfortunatley, he noticed that his shoe had become untied! Surely,
        his parents would not get upset at him for tying his shoes. He stopped and bent down to tie his shoe.
        <br />
        <br />
        Papa Tomato glanced over his shoulder and saw Baby Tomato had stopped once again. Papa Tomato was furious! He stormed back 
        to where Baby Tomato was tying his shoe. He raised his hand, hit Baby Tomato on top of his head, and yelled, "Catch up!"
